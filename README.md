### Extra features
- Sort by
    - Oldest, Newest
    - Least liked, Most liked
    - Lowest bid, Highest bid
    - Lowest price, Highest price
- Rarity filter

The reason behind why the `liked`  filter was deleted is because I integrated it with the `sort by` filter and it was redundant. 

### How to run it
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
